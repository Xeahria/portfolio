        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey, I'm Xeahria, a passionate developer and coding enthusiast. I love building modern and efficient applications that make a difference.</p>
        <p>With over 6 years of experience in JavaScript, Node.js, and Discord.js, and 6 months of experience in HTML & CSS, I have worked on various projects and even collaborated with some notable people in the industry.</p>
        <p>What drives me? Honestly, boredomâ€”it's the best motivator for creativity. I enjoy challenging myself to create new and innovative solutions.</p>
        <p>Right now, I'm showcasing my skills through this portfolio while also taking on some freelance work.</p>
